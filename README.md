## A short introduction

**Zhidan Liu (刘志丹)** is currently an Assistant Professor at [Intelligent Transportation Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/intelligent-transportation/), [System Hub](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Before joining HKUST (GZ), he was an Associate Professor at [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering](http://csse.szu.edu.cn/cn/), [Shenzhen University](http://www.szu.edu.cn/) (2017-2024), and a postdoctoral research fellow at School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) (2015-2017), working closely with [Prof. Mo Li](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~lim/). He received the B.E. degree and Ph.D. degree, both in computer science and technology, from [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in June 2009 and [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in September 2014, respectively. He is now heading the [MobiX](./group.md) research group at HKUST (GZ). He is a senior member of CCF, a member of IEEE and ACM.
